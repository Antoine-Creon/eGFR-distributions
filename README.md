# eGFR Distribution Explorer

A Shiny web application to visualize estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) distributions by age, sex, and equation. The app allows users to compare individual eGFR values against population-based distributions and provides interpretative guidance.

📄 The scientific basis of this application is presented in the following article: **[Yang Y, et al., Kidney International, 2025]()**

🌐 The interactive tool is available at the following link: **[eGFR percentiles](https://scream.meb.ki.se/egfr-percentiles/)**

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive eGFR plots**: Compare an individual creatinine-based eGFR to population percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th).  
- **Multiple equations supported**: CKD-EPI 2009 (without race coefficient), CKD-EPI 2021, EKFC, and Revised Lund-Malmö.  
- **Percentile computation**: Provides the closest percentile for a given age, sex and eGFR.  
- **Interpretation guidance**: Suggests clinical considerations based on eGFR and percentile.
